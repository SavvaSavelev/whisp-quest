# Whisp Quest

Whisp Quest is a small experimental experience where words summon spirits. The frontâ€‘end is built with React, Three.js and Vite, while an Express server talks to OpenAI to analyze text and drive the spirit dialog.

## Server setup

1. `cd whisp-server`
2. `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file and define `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key. You can also set `PORT` (defaults to `4000`).
4. Run `node index.js` to start the server.

## Client setup

1. In the repository root run `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in the browser.

## OpenAI configuration

The server reads the key from `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Either create `whisp-server/.env` or export the variable before launching the server.
